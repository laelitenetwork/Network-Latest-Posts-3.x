== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why did you do this plugin? =
Because I have 3 blogs and I needed a way to display the latest posts from them in the main blog of my Network.

= If I want you to add a new feature, will you do it? =
I like new ideas, but please keep it real and be patient, I try to work as fast as I can but I have also other things to do :).

= What do I need in order to make this plugin work for me? =
Technically nothing, but the pagination feature uses jQuery to load the content without reloading the page. It's prettier that way but it's up
to you (pagination is not Javascript dependant, no jQuery = no fancy loading effects that's all). jQuery is included by default in WordPress, so you don't need to do anything or add anything.

= I can't see the thumbnails =
Your theme have to support thumbnails, just add this to the function.php inside your theme folder:
`add_theme_support('post-thumbnails');`

= OMG this plugin is awesome! I want to buy you a coke and send you a message, where can I do it? =
